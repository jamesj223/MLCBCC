# Machine Learning Comic Book Cover Classifier

## Overview

A series of scripts to use machine learning to find and extract covers from comic books. 

Most comic book files will have the cover as the first page, but often they will have multiple covers. Sometimes these are included at the start, sometimes at the end, and sometimes they are spread throughout the book. The goal of this project is to be able to run it against a directory full of comic book files, and have it extract all of the images it thinks are covers, so that they can be used to generate a cool collage (see the examples section below)
